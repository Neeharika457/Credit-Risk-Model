# Credit-Risk-Model


This project is a web-based application designed to assess credit risk and calculate default probability based on various financial and demographic inputs. The model uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of default and provide insights into creditworthiness, credit score, and rating.

### Features
* User-friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for entering key financial and personal data.
* Credit Score & Default Probability: Calculates default probability and provides a credit score based on the input data.
* Risk Rating: Displays risk rating as Poor, Fair, Good, etc., based on the calculated credit score.
* Dynamic Loan Metrics: Calculates metrics like Loan to Income Ratio in real-time.
* Customizable Loan Settings: Choose loan purpose and type (secured/unsecured) to adjust risk prediction.
  
### Inputs
The application accepts the following inputs:

* Age: Age of the applicant.
* Income: Annual income of the applicant.
* Loan Amount: Total loan amount requested.
* Loan to Income Ratio: Calculated as Loan Amount / Income.
* Loan Tenure (months): Duration of the loan in months.
* Average Days Past Due (Avg DPD): Average number of days payments are overdue.
* Delinquency Ratio: Ratio of missed or delayed payments.
* Credit Utilization Ratio: Ratio of credit used compared to available credit.
* Open Loan Accounts: Number of active loan accounts.
* Residence Type: Whether the residence is rented, owned, etc.
* Loan Purpose: Purpose of the loan (e.g., Home, Car, Education).
* Loan Type: Type of loan (e.g., Secured, Unsecured).
  
### Outputs
* Default Probability: Probability (as a percentage) that the applicant will default on the loan.
* Credit Score: Calculated credit score based on the inputs.
* Risk Rating: Risk assessment as Poor, Fair, or other categories based on the credit score.
